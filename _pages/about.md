Hi.  

I'm Philipp, a doctoral researcher at Technical University Munich and the Postdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. I work at the intersection of deep learning and Earth system modelling to develop new methods that combine the strengths from data-driven machine learning and physics-based models.
