Hi, I'm Philipp. 

I am a doctoral researcher at Technical University Munich and the Postdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. I work at the intersection of deep learning and Earth system modelling to develope novel methods that combine the strengths of both data-driven and knowledge-based modelling approaches.
